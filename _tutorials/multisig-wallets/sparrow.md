## Transaction management

Sparrow has pretty good transaction management. It has more advanced
features that help you inspect the transaction to be more efficient or more private.

## Privacy

Sparrow has a feature for coinjoining, which allows you to stay private. After all, you don't want anyone you pay to see what you have in your wallet.

## Good signing device support

One of the best things about Sparrow is the great signing device (aka hardware wallet) support.
