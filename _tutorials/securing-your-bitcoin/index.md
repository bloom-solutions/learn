# Securing Your Bitcoin

Keeping your Bitcoin and crypto safe is challenging, but it is something that
can be learned.

Remember: "security" and "ease of use" work against one other. The more secure something
is, the harder it is to use it. Opening a bank vault is more complicated
than opening your wallet. That is done intentionally.

Despite that, fortunately, it has been been getting easier to custody your Bitcoin.

In this series, you'll learn the core concepts of securing Bitcoin. The concepts
will apply to other crypto as well, but the examples will be Bitcoin specific.

This is not meant to be an in-depth tutorial on how to set this up. This is
a starting point for your journey to securing your assets yourself.
