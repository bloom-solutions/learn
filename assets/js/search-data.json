    "content": "This really depends on how much you’re storing and what kind of setup you have. Generally, we recommend that you buy from manufacturers directly. This limits who has come in contact with the device and lessen the chances that the devices have been tampered with. However, this isn’t always realistic. What’s important is that you know what the trade off is by buying here vs buying direct. From where, you can make a decision. Furthermore, having a proper multisig setup can reduce the chances of your assets being stolen by a hacker of a tampered device to almost zero. Sounds cool right? We’ll cover that that is next time. Can’t wait? Check this interview with Michael Flaxman. ",
