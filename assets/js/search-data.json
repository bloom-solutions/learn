Despite that, fortunately, it has been been getting easier to custody your Bitcoin. In this series, you’ll learn the core concepts of securing Bitcoin. The concepts will apply to other crypto as well, but the examples will be Bitcoin specific. This is not meant to be an in-depth tutorial on how to set this up.
