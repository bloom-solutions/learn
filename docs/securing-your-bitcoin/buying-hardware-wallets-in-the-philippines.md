# Should I buy signing devices in the Philippines?

This really depends on how much you're storing and what kind of setup you have.

Generally, we recommend that you buy from manufacturers directly. This limits
who has come in contact with the device and lessen the chances that the devices
have been tampered with.

However, this isn't always realistic. What's important is that you know what
the trade off is by buying here vs buying direct. From where, you can make a decision.

Furthermore, having a proper multisig setup can reduce the chances of
your assets being stolen by a hacker of a tampered device to almost zero.

Sounds cool right? We'll cover that that is next time. Can't wait?

# Where do I buy signing devices in the Philippines?

If you've decided to buy signing devices in the Philippines, we suggest looking
at official resellers.

If you wanted one of the more specialized devices such as the Coldcard, then use
a freight forwarding service such as [ShippingCart](https://www.shippingcart.com/).
You'll pay a little extra but when it comes to security, it's worth it.
