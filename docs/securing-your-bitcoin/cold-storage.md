# What is cold storage?

Cold storage is a method of storing data that aren't accessed often.

When it comes to Bitcoin and crypto, cold storage means that the bitcoins are "offline".
They are not on a phone or computer that is connected to the Internet.

The purpose of having your bitcoin offline is that a hacker connected through
the Internet cannot reach it.

It's a lot like a castle surrounded by a moat with the drawbridge up.

When you want to send out Bitcoin, however, you don't bring the computer online.

## How do you send Bitcoin?

When you send Bitcoin out from a mobile app like
[Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/), it's like you're writing out a check
and signing it all from your phone.

When you prepare a bank check, you write:
- whom you're paying
- the date
- the amount

When you're ready to give it, you put your signature.

It's similar with Bitcoin. You need to input:
- the address you're sending to, such as `bc1q6mt760gzxyuwx0sgj4zfa7v4y5fwgutllsry09`
- the amount

When you're ready to send it, you sign it with the private keys.
